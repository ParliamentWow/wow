Scrap jobs, scrap production, and become reliant That is not what I call decarbonisation. I must say, I do feel a little sorry for the Secretary of State, who has been dispatched here today to announce new spending decisions just one day after Labour''s day of shame in winter for PENSIONERS. In government, conservatives provided a grant of million At the time this was one of the largest this support was expected to save at least 5000 jobs in the company. We worked with the Welsh Government and Tata Steel to back million in total.

So is a systemic problem, and there are many many reasons for it, partly driven by finances, but as the honourable member for Sheffield South East said, And there is a lot that we need to work on with that. Now I would like to briefly admit to a slightly guilty pleasure. Which is that I quite like watching the program air crash investigation. but I quite like how the airline industry... is anyone from the LO industry, I will beat you up a little bit, But how they investigate issues that have happened, went wrong and then do not point the finger of blame, no matter where the fault lies, they look at how they could have avoided If only we could make the construction industry well it''s not my fault, it was that sub- it was - - subcontractor, the manufacturer whatever. for a long time and it happens a lot. like how the LO industry investigates problems, could learn something from in the construction industry, just mentioned issues with fire safety issues, if we could, if we think about, how many of you, I''m sure very many people in this chamber have a safety recall notice issued to them, and they fix the issues, the safety issues. anything in the engine that is a safety issue, I would like to see something similar happen in the construction I just like to bring us back to leaseholders because it''s for all of the delay that is happening when Not only is it a fire risk as I mentioned before, other members have mentioned the difficulty in getting mortgages, many leaseholders cannot sell their properties at the moment. I think this assimilation is the housing crisis as well because It means fewer people are able to move out of those is exacerbating the crisis, and other people have mentioned insurance. members have mentioned that social leaving many of the most vulnerable at risk, and I would urge the government and the Minister to listen our cladding scandal campaigns on these issues. And finally, I''d like to reiterate the Liberal Democrat policy on this. I just like to remind that the Liberal Democrats have been calling but making sure that leaseholders don''t have to pay for it, There are other things which are really serious as well. Fire doors are incredibly important.

There are issues around commissions, all sorts of things, putting in insurance as well. to ensure that these things are passed in terms of service charges, fire insurance, there is intervention It might be that we have a similar model, in terms of flooding, to help ring the cost down, there are interventions and so far by the previous government, so we have got to move things forward. There are a platter of issues mentioned earlier, insurance, the previous who is not in its place at the moment, the chair of the Select Committee, referred to mortgages. Issues with mortgages and also he referred to the lack of parity between social housing providers and housing associations, That is something that needs to be addressed. There is a lot of money out there, a lot of Some leaseholders come in buildings such as... There is one in my constituency, they don''t have protections, they are excluded leaseholders. Those flats are not remediated, it means the whole block isn''t, It is more work to be done at pace by there is justice for leaseholders who are The honourable member for Kensington refers I will finish on this, in the report. That is around the regulator. The moment we have got the building safety regulator, I''m not convinced they are resourced how they should be, the honourable member referred to that, that makes and confusion around accountability and several pots of finance, we need actually won a single regulator. and try to remediate those buildings at pace. Finally, justice certainly about showing up all of the buildings and the country, ensuring that they are safe and that those responsible for this, are brought to account by criminal prosecutions. >> Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am delighted to speak in this debate and I want This debate, about building safety, comes on the back of the report on the Grenfell fire and that report should be very sobering reading for everybody who represents It catalogues the way in which privatisation, underfunding, led to a vulnerable group of tenants being left in He concludes in his report, not one of those deaths... He points out that every single one of those deaths could have been avoided had there been proper regulation and protection. His proposals are far-reaching and I look forward to the government On how they will ensure there is proper regulation in the future, But above all, a role for local government as being and to ensure that they are all safe and all The idea of deregulation that can bring about safety is obviously a nonsense. >> With the honourable Member agree with me that the recent changes that are required proving inspectors to be certified is to be welcomed? where supervision was done by local financially tied to the contractor, whole deregulated system with approved inspectors? Perhaps the government should look carefully at changing it? The watchword has to be the independence of inspection. The idea that developers can mark their got to be got rid of sharpish because it is very dangerous precedent. This horrible fire at Grenfell did not come from nowhere. There were other fires, there was constant reference and the lack of fire equipment and fire safety that goes with it. This has got to be the most massive wake-up call there has ever been. It also shows the way in which communities frankly with contempt by the local authority, by regulators and others.

It was a mixed group of working class tenants On the day that the report came out, the cladding might as well have been made with So we do need something to be done very quickly about this. But that means also looking at how we deal with remedial actions. In the Grenfell fire took place, there were immediate inspections made of all buildings all over the country. By and large, local authorities responded well, and did remove cladding, in the case of my own local authority, building in my constituency, However, other buildings in the private sector or other buildings that were It is the tenants or residents or leaseholders that are I will give an example, on a development called Highbury Square in my constituency, A nice development that has been well developed apparently The problem is, it has cladding that has not And therefore the insurance costs are very high. The developers don''t want to pay for the remedial work, and despite numerous meetings with ministers in Families there cannot sell, cannot move, cannot do anything. I intervention with the Minister earlier was their own flat should be compensated. And also, the stress levels amongst people who live in these Compensation should be paid to them. If there is to be a huge dispute about who is going to pay for all this, but it is responsibility of government, if necessary, to step in and do the work and charge it to the owners of of the problem in the first place. In that case, it is Aviva Pension Fund who are responsible. In the case of Creighton Park in my constituency, the ministry is aware, the previous government on this and many officials. It is a company that are trying to evade their responsibilities So I do appeal to the Minister to look very carefully at the excessive delays that have taken place by endless arguments by developers and by the owners of freehold that actually put people at risk and put people at enormous cost as a result of it. the case including some of those at the former Arsenal Stadium site. I think this debate is about all of that, in which communities respond and responded I went there the day after the fire. unbelievably brave in trying to deal with a fire there''d never seen before, Their bravery was enormous and huge. of our media and others who tried to put they are the last persons to be blamed.

The fact there was dangerous cladding, and that it would take time to the level of risk both to resident in taller buildings and also some low rise flats as well which are below the limit has been set. poorly designed fire doors, the need for waking watches, and the incredible work to carry out measures over a number of years.

About particular challenges, about things like in buildings which may not be spotted at I have personal experience again this where in a local authority we commissioned a school and discovered That''s an example where we have to ask who and to carry out your duties you have to have a specific part of the building taken apart to see how it''s done, how that can be reasonable and can be resourced by local authorities items such as fire doors and fire stopping do not arise and create risks that can''t be effectively managed for the future. of the current set of building safety challenges that we all face. I''m well aware having been in local government throughout the previous Labour government was to create arm''s-length Some members made particularly positive references to I would simply urge members as they begin to think about how they would wish to resource some of this work in the public sector building stock that we don''t see it as simply a return of that approach of let''s create arm''s-length management organisations, and let''s expect them to carry out the work. we know there were times when they couldn''t access the funding under the previous government where they couldn''t carry out the work. but it''s more effective to do it in-house, having a high visibility of that work is the way forward. I would urge people that is the way to leverage additional funding into the sector without direct cost to the government, the accountability for those resources being provided will be. The member for Chippenham in her maiden speech made references to the challenges around flooding as an challenge, we also need to reflect that this making sure that in particular very vulnerable residents aren''t based at risk with a failure to carry out proper inspection of safety systems, and to ensure those building regulations as they should in order to keep people safe from that particular risk. we have been able to touch on many different elements I hope that will inform Ministers thinking. to press Ministers for an answer today, we heard in the opening a decision has the use of the EU standards in respect of construction materials.
